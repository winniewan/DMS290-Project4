        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The German Shepherd Dog (Deutshe Schäferhund) descends from the family of German herding dogs that, until the late
          19th century, varied in type from district to district. In the waning years of the 1800s, a German cavalry officer,
          Captain Max von Stephanitz, made it his mission to develop the ideal German herder. Von Stephanitz and like-minded
          breeders crossed various strains from the northern and central districts of Germany, resulting in the ancestors of
          today’s German Shepherd Dog (GSD). Von Stephanitz co-founded the world’s first club devoted to GSDs and spent 35 years
          promoting and refining the breed. Today, the GSD’s versatility is so thoroughly deployed in the performance of myriad.

          GSDs became popular in the United States in the early 1900s, thanks in part to the adventures of canine movie stars
          Rin-Tin-Tin and Strongheart. The GSD is among those German breeds, the Dachshund is another, that suffered from anti-German
          sentiment during and after the world wars. In World War I–era Britain, the breed was referred to as the Alsatian, a name
          many British dog lovers still prefer. With the rise of modern livestock management and the decline of herding as a canine
          occupation, von Stephanitz shrewdly promoted his breed as an ideal K-9 worker. The GSD is today the preferred dog for
          police and military units the world over.

        <h3>Temperament</h3>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <p>
          Generally considered dogkind’s finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile,
          muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the
          German Shepherd is truly a dog lover’s delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at
          the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles.
          The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.
        </p>

        <h4>Activities</h4>
        <p>
          As a very active and athletic breed, the German Shepherd requires lots of exercise for his physical
          and mental well-being. A dog who is not exercised enough will become frustrated and likely to develop
          undesirable behaviors. With a puppy, you can start with short daily walks, as well as play sessions
          in a safely fenced area. Remember to not let the dog off leash, as even the best-trained dog can become
          distracted and not follow every command. Participating in canine activities such as agility, herding.
        </p>

        <h4>Training</h4>
        <p>
          Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital, and continuing obedience training will help
          ensure that the pup will grow to be an adaptable and well-mannered adult. The German Shepherd is a highly
          intelligent companion and an extraordinary worker. Consistency and positive, reward-based training will
          yield excellent results. He is extremely bonded to his people, so he is happiest when he lives with his
          family. He should be raised in the household and exposed to the family’s activities. The German Shepherd
          Dog Club of America provides detailed training advice for owners on the club’s website.

      <h3>Care</h3>

        <div class="col">
          <h4>Health</h4>
          <p>
            Most German Shepherds are healthy dogs. A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions
            such as degenerative myelopathy and elbow and hip dysplasia. German Shepherd Dogs can experience bloat, a sudden
            and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to
            do should bloat occur. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but
            experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands.

          <h4>Diet</h4>
          <p>
            A high-quality dog food appropriate for the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the
            breed needs. Table scraps can cause digestive upset, so only give them sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding
            cooked bones and foods with high fat content. Small pieces of biscuit or the dog’s kibble can be used as treats
            for training. If you are feeding a high-quality food, vitamin and mineral supplements should not be necessary,
            although adding small quantities of yogurt, cooked vegetables, or eggs to the food can be beneficial. Learn about
            which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s
            weight or diet.

          <h4>Grooming</h4>
          <p>
            The German Shepherd Dog has a medium-length, double coat consisting of a dense, harsh, and close-lying outer
            coat with a softer undercoat. The breed is easy to maintain, usually requiring just a quick brushing every
            few days or so to help remove loose hairs, but they do shed more profusely once or twice a year. During
            these periods, more frequent brushing will help control the amount of hair that ends up around the house
            and on the furniture. The German Shepherd only needs an occasional bath. It is important to trim or grind
            his nails every month if they are not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause pain and structural issues.
