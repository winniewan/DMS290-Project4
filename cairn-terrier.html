            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The Cairn is one of several terrier breeds, some still extant others now extinct, who for centuries 
                patrolled the game preserves and farms of Scotland. Unravelling the histories of these breeds is difficult 
                because for so many years they were lumped together as simply Scotch terriers. Not until the late 1800s 
                did breed fanciers devise strict breeding programs and classifications for this hardy family of 
                exterminators. The name Cairn Terrier did not appear in print until 1887, though by then the Cairn-type 
                terrier had been around for a long time. Cairns were known from at least the 1600s to dwell in the Western 
                Highlands, most notably on the Isle of Skye, birthplace of their kinsman the Skye Terrier.

                Once upon a time in Scotland, a mound of stones used as a boundary or to mark a grave was called a “cairn.” 
                On Highland game preserves, rodents would live within and beneath these rock piles. The Cairn Terrier, among 
                the smallest of the go-to-ground terriers, was developed to dig into cairns and rout out the critters. When 
                grouped in packs, these plucky little hunters also worked on foxes, otters, and other predators. The Cairn’s 
                independence, courage, toughness, and alertness were qualities that served them well when digging into a cairn 
                alone and confronting sharp-toothed mammals.

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            
            <h4>Personality</h4>
            <p>
                Cairn Terriers are happy, busy little earthdogs originally bred to fearlessly root out foxes and other 
                small, furred prey in the rocky Scottish countryside. Curious and alert, Cairns like having a place 
                where they can explore and dig. The Cairn’s unique qualities, called “Cairnishness,” include a short, 
                wide head and a free-moving, short-legged body that exudes strength but not heaviness, topping out at 
                about 10 inches high and about 15 inches long. The double coat is harsh and wiry on top and downy beneath. 
                A Cairn presents as a small, shaggy, alert dog, with head, tail, and ears up, and eyes shining with intelligence.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Activities</h4>
            <p>
                Cairns require a moderate amount of exercise and can adapt well to various living situations when 
                given daily outings. They can thrive anywhere from a Highlands farm to an urban high-rise and are 
                excellent all-around dogs. Training for dog sports provides an ideal outlet for their energy. The 
                breed exercises body and mind by participating in obedience, tracking, herding, agility, earthdog 
                events, coursing ability tests, and other activities that dog and owner can enjoy together.
            </p>

            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>
                Cairns are very smart and love their families, but they may try to test their owner’s limits, so 
                obedience training is necessary. Although they learn quickly, the Cairn may always have the instinct 
                to dig and chase small animals, so new owners should be prepared for these behaviors. Early socialization 
                and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, 
                well-mannered companion.

            <h3>Care</h3>
            
            <h4>Health</h4>
            <p>
                Cairn Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders test their stock for health disorders 
                and communicate with other dedicated breeders regularly, working together for breed health and preservation 
                of the breed’s unique qualities. These hardy little dogs can do well in hot and cold environments. Their 
                thick wiry fur and soft downy undercoat keep them warm in the winter.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Diet</h4>
            <p>
                The Cairn Terrier should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or 
                home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to 
                the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your 
                dog’s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving 
                too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check 
                with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be 
                available at all times.
            </p>

            <h4>Grooming</h4>
            <p>
                Cairn Terriers are generally easy keepers, although weekly brushing and combing are recommended, as 
                well as periodic hand-stripping to maintain the coat’s texture. Having a comb and soft slicker brush 
                handy will help with the grooming tasks. With a new puppy, spending time together in grooming sessions 
                helps to accustom him or her to being worked with and is an opportunity to develop the bond between you. 
                The nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.
