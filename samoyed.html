            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The name Samoyed comes from the Samoyedic people (also Samodeic people), a semi-nomadic people from Asia who migrated to 
                Siberia a thousand years ago, of the family of Sayantsi. They bred dogs for hard work in the coldest habitable places on 
                earth. (In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common.) The Samoyede people 
                lived in tents and huddled for warmth with their dog packs during the Arctic nights. This type of human-canine cooperation 
                for mutual survival forged a tight bond between Samoyed dogs and people. When not sledging heavy loads across vast expanses 
                of Siberia, Samoyed dogs earned their feed as watchdogs and hunters. The Samoyede depended on reindeer as a vital source of food.

                In the late 18th century, Arctic explorers returning to England introduced the Samoyed to British dog lovers. Queen Alexandra 
                was an admirer who did much to promote the breed as a companion and show dog. In America, a sparkling white dog named Moustan 
                of Argenteau made history in 1906 as the first of the breed (then known as the Samoyede) registered by the AKC. American and 
                European mushers of the early 20th century knew the Samoyed as an enthusiastic hauler of supplies, capable of sledging one and 
                a half times their own weight. Scott, Shackleton, and Amundsen are a few of the era’s famous explorers who rode behind Sammies 
                through frozen expanses.

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            
            <h4>Personality</h4>
            <p>
                The Samoyed is a substantial but graceful dog standing anywhere from 19 to a bit over 23 inches at the 
                shoulder. Powerful, tireless, with a thick all-white coat impervious to cold—Sammies are perfectly beautiful 
                but highly functional. Even their most delightful feature, a perpetual smile, has a practical function: The 
                upturned corners of the mouth keep Sammies from drooling, preventing icicles from forming on the face. Samoyeds, 
                the smiling sledge dogs, were bred for hard work in the world’s coldest locales. In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, 
                for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Activities</h4>
            <p>
                Samoyeds enjoy being with their people and participating in family activities. They need some daily 
                exercise and enjoy play sessions with their owner in a safely fenced yard or long walks on leash. The 
                breed has a strong urge to run away and roam, and if loose a Sammie might travel for miles, putting 
                himself at risk. These are smart, social, mischievous dogs who demand love and attention. Sammies need a 
                very firm but loving hand in training.
            </p>

            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>
                The Samoyede people lived in tents and huddled for warmth with their dogs on brutal Arctic nights. This 
                unusual degree of dog-and-master closeness forged a tight bond between Sammies and humankind. A Sammy 
                sentenced to solitary confinement in the backyard is a miserable—and destructive—creature. These are smart, 
                social, mischievous dogs who demand love and attention. Sammies need a firm but loving hand in training. 
                Because of the depth of chest required, the legs should be moderately long. General appearance should 
                include movement and general conformation, indicating balance and good substance.

            <h3>Care</h3>
            
            <h4>Health</h4>
            <p>
                Samoyeds are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders test their stock for health conditions such as hip 
                dysplasia and eye and cardiac disorders. The Samoyed’s teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed 
                for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.
                The Samoyed, being essentially a working dog, should present a picture of beauty, alertness and strength, with agility, 
                dignity and grace. As his work lies in cold climates, his coat should be heavy and weather-resistant, well groomed, 
                and of good quality rather than quantity.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Diet</h4>
            <p>
                The Samoyed should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your 
                veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). 
                Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be 
                an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, 
                and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water 
                should be available at all times.
            </p>

            <h4>Grooming</h4>
            <p>
                The Samoyed has a profuse double coat, with a longer outer coat of harsh hair and a soft, thick, wooly undercoat. 
                Samoyeds shed quite a bit all the time, even more so during shedding season, which can occur once or twice a year. 
                Daily brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hairs and keep the dog looking his best. Mats or tangles can be 
                worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. The nails should be trimmed every three to four weeks or as needed. 
                Because of the depth of chest required, the legs should be moderately long. General appearance should include 
                movement and general conformation, indicating balance and good substance.
