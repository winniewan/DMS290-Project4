# Choreography

**LATCH Framework**: The methodology for the order of the content that I will use when I build my Project 4 is category - history, appearance, temperament, living needs. Then, within each category, I am going to use a hierarchy logical method. For example, if I am talking about history about the breed of the dog, I am going to order the information heirachically, where they were from in location and time period, then what they were used for, and some following interesting facts about that unique breed. Staying consistent with the category and then heirachy keeps the website clean and easy to navigate or read. 



In addition to defining the order of the content for each dog breed, I am planning to order the dog breed by smallest size to largest size, so there is some sense of consistency or ordering that will help the user browse through it smoothly. This is a great method to use because some users may be interested in smaller dogs, whereas others like medium size or bigger dogs. Then they can easily navigate towards their own interest!
