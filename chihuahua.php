            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Likenesses of Chihuahua-like dogs decorate the artifacts of lost civilizations around the world. Trading among
              ancient cultures was more widespread than commonly assumed, so it is no surprise that similar dog types took
              root in far-flung places. How the Chihuahua type first came to the peoples of Mexico, however, is a secret of
              prehistory. We do know that when the Toltecs held sway in Mexico about a thousand years ago, their breed of
              choice was the Techichi, a larger, heavier ancestor of today’s Chi. The Aztecs conquered the Toltecs in the 12th
              century. Historians credit the Aztecs with refining the Techichi into a smaller, lighter dog.

              But the hardy little dogs lived on in remote villages and, in the mid-1800s, when Americans began to take an
              interest in the breed, they found many specimens in the State of Chihuahua. So it was that this survivor of
              two lost civilizations gained worldwide fame as the Chihuahua. The first AKC-registered Chihuahua, a little
              guy named Beppie, was recorded in 1908. The famous bandleader Xavier Cugat did much to popularize Chihuahuas
              in the 1940s and 50s. More recently, these natural performers stole the show in “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,”
              “Legally Blonde,” and “Sex and the City.” The minor-league baseball team of El Paso, Texas, is named the Chihuahuas.

              <div class="col">
                <h4>Personality</h4>
                <p>
                  The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico, these alert and amusing
                  "purse dogs" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going back to the ancient
                  kingdoms of pre-Columbian times. The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor,
                  weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded “apple” head is a breed hallmark. The erect ears and full,
                  luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short.
                  The varieties are identical except for coat.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h4>Activities</h4>
                <p>
                  The Chihuahua loves to run and play and can usually get enough exercise in a very small space.
                  Simply trotting around following their people is usually enough exercise for this happy breed.
                  Short, slow walks will keep your dog in good weight and condition. Avoid overexerting the Chihuahua.
                  If your dog is panting and working hard to keep up, it’s time to pick him up and carry him home.
                </p>

                <h4>Training</h4>
                <p>
                  The Chihuahua is a very alert little dog of high intelligence. He is eager to please his humans and
                  responds well to positive training practices. Chihuahuas seem well aware of how cute they are and learn
                  how to get their way. From the very beginning you must enforce the fact that you are in charge. Never
                  allow your Chihuahua puppy to do anything that will be unacceptable in an adult. They can have a bit
                  of a “terrier” temperament, so a firm but gentle hand is necessary when training. They can excel in
                  obedience training and other canine sports.

        <!-- CARE -->
        <section>
          <div>
            <h3 class="pb-4">Care</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col">
                <h4>Health</h4>
                <p>
                  The majority of Chihuahuas are healthy little dogs, but there are some genetic issues that can affect the breed.
                  You should choose your dog from a breeder who routinely does genetic health screenings on all breeding stock to
                  ensure that the puppies they produce are as genetically sound as possible. Some of the issues that can possibly
                  affect the Chihuahua include potential heart problems (patent ductus arteriosus, mitral valve disease), eye
                  disease, and patellar luxation (loose kneecaps). Idiopathic epilepsy is also known to occur in the breed.

              <div class="col">
                <h4>Diet</h4>
                <p>
                  A high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the
                  nutrients the breed needs. Some Chihuahuas are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s
                  calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too
                  many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones
                  and foods with high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not.
                  Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.

                <h4>Grooming</h4>
                <p>
                  The two coat varieties of the Chihuahua have slightly different grooming needs. The smooth-coat Chihuahua
                  will need only occasional brushing and regular baths to look dapper, while the longhaired variety should
                  have his coat brushed at least once a week to avoid any tangles or mats. Both varieties should have their
                  nails trimmed regularly. Good dental care is necessary and should include brushing your dog’s teeth, and
                  the vet might also recommend treats designed as part of a tooth-care program. Check the Chihuahua’s ears
                  regularly, and remove any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections.
