        <h3>Chihuahua</h3>
        <p>
          Likenesses of Chihuahua-like dogs decorate the artifacts of lost civilizations around the world. Trading among
          ancient cultures was more widespread than commonly assumed, so it is no surprise that similar dog types took
          root in far-flung places. How the Chihuahua type first came to the peoples of Mexico, however, is a secret of
          prehistory. We do know that when the Toltecs held sway in Mexico about a thousand years ago, their breed of
          choice was the Techichi, a larger, heavier ancestor of today’s Chi. The Aztecs conquered the Toltecs in the 12th
          century. Historians credit the Aztecs with refining the Techichi into a smaller, lighter dog.

        <h3>Cairn Terrier</h3>
        <p>
          The Cairn is one of several terrier breeds, some still extant others now extinct, who for centuries
          patrolled the game preserves and farms of Scotland. Unravelling the histories of these breeds is difficult
          because for so many years they were lumped together as simply Scotch terriers. Not until the late 1800s
          did breed fanciers devise strict breeding programs and classifications for this hardy family of
          exterminators. The name Cairn Terrier did not appear in print until 1887, though by then the Cairn-type
          terrier had been around for a long time. Cairns were known from at least the 1600s to dwell in the Western
          Highlands, most notably on the Isle of Skye, birthplace of their kinsman the Skye Terrier.

        <h3>Samoyed</h3>
        <p>
          The name Samoyed comes from the Samoyedic people (also Samodeic people), a semi-nomadic people from Asia who migrated to
          Siberia a thousand years ago, of the family of Sayantsi. They bred dogs for hard work in the coldest habitable places on
          earth. (In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common.) The Samoyede people
          lived in tents and huddled for warmth with their dog packs during the Arctic nights. This type of human-canine cooperation
          for mutual survival forged a tight bond between Samoyed dogs and people. When not sledging heavy loads across vast expanses
          of Siberia, Samoyed dogs earned their feed as watchdogs and hunters. The Samoyede depended on reindeer as a vital source of food.

        <h3>German Shepherd</h3>
        <p>
          The German Shepherd Dog (Deutshe Schäferhund) descends from the family of German herding dogs that, until the late
          19th century, varied in type from district to district. In the waning years of the 1800s, a German cavalry officer,
          Captain Max von Stephanitz, made it his mission to develop the ideal German herder. Von Stephanitz and like-minded
          breeders crossed various strains from the northern and central districts of Germany, resulting in the ancestors of
          today’s German Shepherd Dog (GSD). Von Stephanitz co-founded the world’s first club devoted to GSDs and spent 35 years
          promoting and refining the breed. Today, the GSD’s versatility is so thoroughly deployed in the performance of myriad.
